## 🚗 Project Overview

The **EV Battery Monitoring Website** is designed to:
- Display real-time sensor data from EVs (temperature, humidity, voltage, current).
- Help identify early signs of battery issues.
- Provide predictive maintenance status and alerts using Machine Learning.
- Ensure better safety and efficiency in electric vehicle battery management.

## ✨ Features

- 🌡️ Monitoring of temperature, voltage, current, and humidity
- 🧠 Unsupervised anomaly detection using Isolation Forest algorithm
- ⚠️ Conditional alert system based on researched safety thresholds
- 🔥 Firebase integration for live sensor data from ESP32
- 🚀 Hosted via GitHub Pages for easy access
- 🕒 Historical alert log with date and time, stored and displayed from Firebase  
- 📉 Predictive maintenance score with reason-based insights based on past alert patterns 
- 📱 Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- 🌐 Clean and intuitive user interface

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend / Database**: Firebase (Realtime Database used to collect data from ESP32)
- **Machine Learning**:
  - **Isolation Forest** (unsupervised learning for anomaly detection)
  - Threshold-based condition checks from research papers
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages

## ℹ️ Important Instructon!
- As this project requires hardware to be connected to EV to get the live data.
- So it is giving you previously stored data which is currently present in the firebase.
